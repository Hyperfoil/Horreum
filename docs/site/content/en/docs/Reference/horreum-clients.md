Starting from version `0.13`, Horreum comes with some autogenerated clients out of the box that can be used to interact with
the Horreum server programmatically.

Right now there are two clients, one for [`Python`](https://github.com/Hyperfoil/horreum-client-python/) and the other one for [`Go`](https://github.com/Hyperfoil/horreum-client-golang/).

Both clients are autogenerated using [Kiota](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openapi/kiota/) openapi generator, and at the moment of writing the autogenerated client is directly exposed
through the `HorreumClient` instance. Therefore, the interaction with the raw client follows the Kiota experience, more details can be found in the [Kiota documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openapi/kiota/experience).

## Prerequisites

In the below sections you can find some usage examples for both clients, here the prerequisites to properly running below examples:

1. You must have Horreum server up and running (and accessible). You can find more details on how to setup Horreum server in the [Get Started](/docs/tutorials/get-started) section.
2. Generate an API key following these [instructions](/docs/tasks/api-keys/#api-key-creation). Then replace `HUSR_00000000_0000_0000_0000_000000000000` with your generated key.

## Python Client

Install the latest Horreum client

```bash
pip install horreum
```

Import required Python libraries
```python
import asyncio
```

> `asyncio` is required because the client leverages it to perform async requests to the server.

```python
from horreum import new_horreum_client, ClientConfiguration, AuthMethod, HorreumCredentials
```

> `new_horreum_client` utility function to setup the `HorreumClient` instance

Initialize the Horreum client

```python
client = await new_horreum_client(
	base_url="http://localhost:8080",
	credentials=HorreumCredentials(
		apikey="HUSR_00000000_0000_0000_0000_000000000000"
	),
	client_config=ClientConfiguration(
		auth_method=AuthMethod.API_KEY
	)
)
```

Now let's start playing with it

```python
# sync call
print("Client version:", client.version())

# async call
print("Server version:", (await client.raw_client.api.config.version.get()).version)
```

As you might have noticed, the Kiota api follows the REST url pattern. The previous async call was the equivalent of doing 
`curl -X 'GET' 'http://localhost:8080/api/config/version'`. The URL pattern `api/config/version` is replaced by dot notation
`api.config.version.<HTTP_METHOD>`.

## Golang Client

Install the latest Horreum client

```bash
go get github.com/hyperfoil/horreum-client-golang
```

Import required Go libraries
```go
import (
	"github.com/hyperfoil/horreum-client-golang/pkg/horreum"
)
```

Define username and password

```go
var (
	apiKey = "HUSR_00000000_0000_0000_0000_000000000000"
)
```

Initialize the Horreum client

```go
client, err := horreum.NewHorreumClient("http://localhost:8080", 
	&horreum.HorreumCredentials{
		ApiKey: &apiKey,
	}, &horreum.ClientConfiguration{
		AuthMethod: horreum.API_KEY,
	})

if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("error creating Horreum client: %s", err.Error())
}
```

Now let's start playing with it

```go
// sync call
fmt.Printf("Server version: %s\n", *v.GetVersion())

// async call
v, err := client.RawClient.Api().Config().Version().Get(context.Background(), nil)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("error getting server version: %s", err.Error())
    os.Exit(1)
}
```

Similarly to the Python example, the previous async call was the equivalent of doing
`curl -X 'GET' 'http://localhost:8080/api/config/version'`. The URL pattern `api/config/version` is replaced by method chain invocation
`api().config().version().<HTTP_METHOD>`. Here you need to provide your own `context` to the actual HTTP method call.
