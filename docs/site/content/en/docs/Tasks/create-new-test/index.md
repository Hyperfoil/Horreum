After [starting Horreum](/docs/tutorial/start.html) and logging in you'll find a blank table with **New Test** button above:

{{% imgproc logged_in Fit "1200x500" %}}
Manage Teams
{{% /imgproc %}}

All you need to fill in here is the test name. Test names must be unique within Horreum.

{{% imgproc new_test Fit "1200x500" %}}
Manage Teams
{{% /imgproc %}}

When you press the **Save** button on the bottom several other tabs appear on the top; you can go to **Access**. The test was created with **Private** access rights; if you want anonymous users to see your tests you can set it to **Public** and save the test.

{{% imgproc test_access Fit "1200x500" %}}
Manage Teams
{{% /imgproc %}}


When you're done you can navigate to **Tests** in the bar on the top of the screen and see that the test was really created:

{{% imgproc tests Fit "1200x500" %}}
Manage Teams
{{% /imgproc %}}

The test is there but in the Run Count column you don't see any runs. Now you can continue with [uploading data](./upload.html) into Horreum.
