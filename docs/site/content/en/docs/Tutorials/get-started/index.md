## Running Horreum locally

In this tutorial we'll show you how to start Horreum and its infrastructure using container technologies such as `podman` or `docker`.

### Step 0: install required software

Make sure that you have either `podman` and `podman-compose` or `docker` and `docker-compose` installed. Some scripting we have prepared to simplify the startup also requires `curl` and `jq`. On Fedora you would run

```
sudo dnf install -y curl jq podman podman-plugins podman-compose
```

This setup is going to use ports `8080` (Horreum application), `8180` (Keycloak), `4040` (Grafana) and `5432` (PostgreSQL) on `localhost`. Please make sure that these are not used by any other application.

### Step 1: start Horreum

We have prepared a simple script that downloads all the necessary files and starts all containers in host-network mode:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hyperfoil/Horreum/0.6/infra/start.sh | bash
```

After a few moments everything should be up and ready, and a browser pointed to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) will open.

### Step 2: log in

In the upper right corner you should see the **Log in** button. Press that and fill in username `user` and password `secret`. When you sign in the upper right corner you should see that you're authenticated as 'Dummy User'.

You can explore the application but at this moment it is empty. Let's continue with [creating a test and uploading a run](create_test_run.html).

### Step Z: stop Horreum

You can stop and remove all the containers using the command below:

```bash
podman kill $(podman ps -q --filter 'label=io.podman.compose.project=horreum')
podman rm $(podman ps -q -a --filter 'label=io.podman.compose.project=horreum')
```
