> **Prerequisites**:
> 1. Horreum is running, and you have an access token 
> 2. Grafana is running, and you can update dashboards


## Grafana setup

This tutorial uses the [JSON API plugin](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/marcusolsson-json-datasource/) to retrieve data from Horreum.
The JSON API Plugin can be installed from the grafana administrator panel.

{{% imgproc json_api_plugin Fit "1200x300" %}}
Install JSON API Grafana Plugin
{{% /imgproc %}}

Next we need to create a datasource that will connect to the Horreum URL. 
For the example we are connecting to a local development instance of horreum running on localhost using port `8080`.
The datasource url does not have to include the `/api` but including it in the datasource saves us from having to include `/api`
each time we fetch data from the datasource.

{{% imgproc json_api_datasource Fit "980x1200" %}}
Create JSON API datasource
{{% /imgproc %}}

That's it, Grafana is ready to start consuming data from Horreum. The next steps depend on what we want to display in Grafana.

### Key Metrics in Grafana

Horreum accepts any json format for a run and uses Labels (TODO link) to extract or calculate key metrics.
Metric values, referred to as Label Values in horreum, are automatically calculated for each upload. There is an API
to retrieve the values for a specific upload but that would be tedious for comparing across runs. 
The test api endpoint has a `/labelValues` (TODO link to documentation) that can retrieve a filtered list of all the label values from each upload.

> /test/${testId}/labelValues

The response is a list of json objects that contain the labelValue for each upload. There is actually a json object per dataset
but not all runs are parsed into multiple datasets so the distinction is not necessary for most use cases.

```
[
    {  runId: 101, datasetid: 100, values: {metricName: metricValue,...},
    ...
]
```
The key data is in the `values` field of each entry. 
Add a panel to a dashboard in grafana then select the new JSON API datasource as the datasource for the panel.

{{% imgproc json_api_panel_datasource Fit "865x331" %}}
Set panel datasource
{{% /imgproc %}}

Grafana can now access the data but we need to define `fields` to tell the panel how to extract information from the json.
There are 3 fields for the `/labelValues` endpoint:
`values` - the content of the labels
`runId` - the unique ID assigned to the run that was uploaded to horreum
`datasetId` - the unique ID that was assigned to the dataset extracted from the run

The example below defines fields in Grafana for all three but the `values` field is where the metrics are located.

{{% imgproc json_api_panel_fields Fit "865x331" %}}
Define fields for the json
{{% /imgproc %}}

The next step is to define a Grafana transform to turn the `values` into the dataframe structure Grafana expects.
Use the `extract fields` transform on the `values` field from the previous step.

{{% imgproc json_api_panel_transform Fit "865x331" %}}
Define fields for the json
{{% /imgproc %}}

Grafana should now recognize all the labels as different datapoints. 
At this point, customizing the grafana panel depends on what values are found in each label and what kind of panel you want to create.

## Filtering results

There is a good chance you only want data from certain runs. 
The `/labelValues` endpoint supports a `filter` query parameter to filter out datasets.
There are 2 ways to filter:
1. provide a json object that must exist in the label values.
   
   For example, if `version` is a label we can pass in `{"version":"1.2.3"}` to only include datasets where the version value is `1.2.3` 

2. provide a json path (an extractor path from labels) that needs to evaluate to true  

   For example, if `count` is a label we can pass in `$.count ? (@ > 10 && @ < 20)` to only include datasets where count is between 10 and 20.

We set the `filter` parameter by editing the Query for the grafana panel.

{{% imgproc json_api_panel_filter Fit "865x331" %}}
Define filter for query

> docker run -d --name=grafana --env --network="host" grafana/grafana

if you need to access horreum running on localhost (dev mode). Then grafana needs to run on host network so that localhost references
will also need to set a port other than 3000 becuase local dev mode uses 3000

> docker run -d --name=grafana --env GF_SERVER_HTTP_PORT=3030 --network="host" grafana/grafana
